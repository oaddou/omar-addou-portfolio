        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my personal website! I'm Omar, a seasoned supply chain
          professional based in <strong>The Netherlands</strong> with over ten
          years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry mainly in
          <strong>Supply Chain</strong> and <strong>Manufacturing</strong>. I
          have a strong foundation in <strong>GMP</strong> (Good Manufacturing
          Practices) and <strong>GDP</strong> (Good Distribution Practices),
          ensuring compliance and maintaining exceptional quality in every
          operation. I specialize in leveraging <strong>SAP</strong> for supply
          chain management and have knowledge of
          <strong>MES</strong> (Manufacturing Execution Systems) like
          <strong>Körber PAS-X (Werum)</strong>. My expertise includes managing
          deviations, implementing <strong>CAPAs</strong> (Corrective and
          Preventive Actions), and overseeing change controls using platforms
          such as TrackWise and Infinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond my supply chain expertise, I am deeply passionate about
          technology, programming AI. I am currently learning
          <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>,
          <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, with the goal of
          applying these skills to create innovative solutions within the pharma
          supply chain and other industries. My goal is to combine my industry
          knowledge with my growing programming abilities to streamline
          processes, improve efficiency, and contribute to digital
          transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          My professional journey includes roles such as
          <strong>Lead Material Handler</strong> at Bristol-Myers Squibb,
          <strong>Manufacturing Specialist</strong> at Janssen Biologics,
          <strong>Supply Chain Specialist</strong> at Kite Pharma. In each role,
          I have demonstrated my ability to manage inventories, coordinate
          effectively with cross-functional teams, created and managed
          deviations, perform <strong>User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</strong> for
          new systems, and drive process improvement initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am always eager to explore new challenges and collaborate on
          projects that require a blend of technical expertise and supply chain
          knowledge. Feel free to browse through my projects or connect with me
          to discuss potential opportunities.
